#Basic Arithmetic and Operators

## Arithmetic 
Arithmetic can be directly entered into the shell and the output will be returned. Integers and floats can be mixed and can be positive or negative

#### Addition
```Mylanguage
basic > 1 + 2
3
```
#### Subtraction
```Mylanguage
basic > 5 - 10.5
-5.5
```
#### Multiplication
```Mylanguage
basic > 5 * 10
50
```
#### Division
```Mylanguage
basic > 5/4
1.25
```
## Raising to a power
```Mylanguage
basic > 16^(1/2)
```
### Brackets
It is important to note that brackets can change the order of operation in arithmetic. See example below:
```Mylanguage
basic > 16^1/2
8
basic > 16^(1/2)
4
```

```
