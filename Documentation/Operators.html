  <h1>Operators Documentation</h1>
  <p>Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands. In programming, operators are essential for performing various calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.</p>

  <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>+</strong> (Addition): Adds two operands together.</li>
    <li><strong>-</strong> (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.</li>
    <li><strong>*</strong> (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.</li>
    <li><strong>/</strong> (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&gt;</strong> (Greater Than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;</strong> (Less Than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.</li>
    <li><strong>&gt;=</strong> (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;=</strong> (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.</li>
    <li><strong>==</strong> (Equal To): Checks if the left operand is equal to the right operand.</li>
    <li><strong>!=</strong> (Not Equal To): Checks if the left operand is not equal to the right operand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AND</strong>: Returns true if both operands are true.</li>
    <li><strong>OR</strong>: Returns true if at least one operand is true.</li>
    <li><strong>NOT</strong>: Returns the opposite of the operand's value (true becomes false, and vice versa).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These operators are fundamental building blocks in programming and are used extensively for various tasks, including calculations, decision-making, and data manipulation.</p>
