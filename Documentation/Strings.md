# Strings

## Declaration
As in most languages strings are declared with `""` but it is important to note that single quotes are not recognised so are free to use within the file without [Escape Characters](#escape_chars). For example `"This is a 'valid' string"`. 


## Escape Characters <a name = "escape_chars"></a>

Escape Characters allow a character (previously reserved) to escape and is escaped by the `\` character. There are also two preset escape characters. Shown below

- `"\n"` new line
- `"\t"` tab 



operations, comparisons, declaration, escape chars, built in functions
