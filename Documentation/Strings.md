# Strings

## Declaration
As in most languages strings are declared with `""` but it is important to note that single quotes are not recognised so are free to use within the file without [Escape Characters](#escape_chars)


## Escape Characters <a name = "escape_chars"></a>



operations, comparisons, declaration, escape chars, built in functions
