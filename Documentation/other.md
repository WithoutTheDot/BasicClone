Semi colons can be used to create multiline statements on one single line which is useful for the shell. They can also be used in a file but are not neccassery and are for more code readability and line efficiency.
```
VAR a = 10^4 # This is a valid line
VAR b = 10^5; # This is also a valid line
```
